# Simple tool to search images by words given a local directory path
## How it works
* Enter the absolute path of images to search words from
* The tool uses PyTesseract OCR to extract the text from each image and store them in a local MongoDB database
* Once the images texts have been stored, enter the word to search for and get the file paths that contain that word
